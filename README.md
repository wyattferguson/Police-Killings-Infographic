# :rotating_light: Police Killings Infographic

This project is my little way of trying to support the protests happening right now in the US. The data used for this project comes from the [Washington Posts Police Shootings Dataset](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings).

## :rocket: Setup

The site is a Gridsome generated site that ingests the giant csv.

1. `npm install`

2. `gridsome develop` to start a local dev server at `http://localhost:8080`
